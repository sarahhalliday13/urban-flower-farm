##Subagents Created! 🚀

  I've created 6 specialized subagents
  tailored specifically for your Urban
  Flower Farm project:

  1. firebase-specialist 🔥

  - Handles all Firebase operations
  (database, auth, storage, functions)
  - Expertise in security rules and
  real-time data
  - Knows your project's specific Firebase
   patterns

  2. react-component-dev ⚛️

  - Creates and optimizes React components
  - Follows your project's component
  patterns
  - Handles state management and
  performance

  3. order-system-specialist 🛒

  - Manages entire order lifecycle
  - Handles cart, checkout, and order
  processing
  - Expertise in admin features and email
  integration

  4. deployment-manager 🚀

  - Manages builds and deployments
  - Handles branch merging and conflicts
  - Knows your staging/production
  environments

  5. email-template-designer 📧

  - Creates responsive HTML email
  templates
  - Handles order confirmations and
  invoices
  - Ensures cross-client compatibility

  6. bug-hunter 🐛

  - Expert at finding and fixing bugs
  - Systematic debugging approach
  - Knows common issues in your project

  How to Use:

  These subagents will be automatically 
  invoked when you ask about related
  tasks. For example:
  - "Fix the order confirmation email" →
  email-template-designer
  - "Deploy to staging" →
  deployment-manager
  - "Debug why orders aren't saving" →
  bug-hunter + firebase-specialist

  You can also explicitly request a
  subagent:
  - "Use the firebase-specialist to
  optimize my database queries"
  - "Have the bug-hunter investigate this
  error"

  Each subagent has deep knowledge of your
   project's specific patterns, common
  issues, and best practices. They'll help
   you code faster and more efficiently!
