3. **Isolated Context**: Each subagent operates in its own context to maintain focus
4. **Specialized Knowledge**: Each agent has deep knowledge of Urban Flower Farm's specific patterns and requirements

## Examples

‚Üí email-template-designer will handle this

// Explicit invocation

- Common issues and their solutions
- Deployment environments (staging, production)

## Creating New Agents

To create a new subagent:

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with name, description, and tools
3. Write a detailed system prompt
4. Focus on a specific domain

Example:
```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: What this agent does and when to use it
tools: Read, Edit, Bash  # Optional - inherits all if omitted
