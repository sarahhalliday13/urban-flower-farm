# Your rule content

Hello, we are working on the development branch in our staging environment. You MUST review the PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, DEVELOPER.md and admin-refactor.md, order-refactor.md files carefully before you *touch* anything. Do not make changes, commit changes to GitHub or to Production unless directed. Seriously, donâ€™t even think about it.
