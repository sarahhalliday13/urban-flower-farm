# 💻 BUFF Development Standards

Welcome to the Buttons Urban Flower Farm dev repo! This ruleset defines how we work together using Cursor and Git to keep things clean, testable, and future-proof.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure
- Reusable components go in `src/components/`
- Screens/views go in `src/app/`
- Shared utilities → `src/utils/`
- Shared hooks → `src/hooks/`
- Global styles live in `src/styles/global.css`
- Strings for localization (optional) → `src/localization/en.json`
- Theme tokens → `src/theme/`

### Test Structure
- Component tests → `src/components/ComponentName/__tests__/`
- Integration tests → `src//__tests__/`
- Test utilities → `src/__tests__/testUtils.js`
- Test docs → `docs/testing/`
  - Manual test cases → `docs/testing/manual/`
  - Test fixes → `docs/testing/fixes/`

---

## 🎨 Styling Rules
- Use variables from the global stylesheet: **no hardcoded colors, font sizes, or spacing**
- All new components should use theme-based tokens and spacing
- Prefer `{...style1, ...style2}` over `[style1, style2]` if combining styles inline

---

## 🧪 Testing Standards
- Every component must have unit tests in its `__tests__` directory
- Tests must follow this structure:
  ```javascript
  describe('ComponentName', () => {
    describe('functionality', () => {
      // Core functionality tests
    });
    
    describe('accessibility', () => {
      // A11y compliance tests
    });
    
    describe('snapshot', () => {  // Optional
      // Snapshot tests if needed
    });
  });
  ```
- Integration/screen tests go in `/src/__tests__/`
- Use shared test utilities from `testUtils.js`
- Document manual test procedures in `docs/testing/manual/`
- Run **all tests locally** before committing or merging

---

## 🌀 Cursor + Git Rules
- Work only in `development` branch unless instructed otherwise
- `main` and `working-build` are protected — **do not commit directly**
- Do not deploy to staging or production without team approval
- Review these files before major work:
  - `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
  - `DEVELOPER.md`
  - `docs/project-guardrails/` directory

---

## 🧠 Project Guardrails Reference
These rules defer to domain-specific guardrails stored in `docs/project-guardrails/`. Key areas include:
- Admin system architecture and workflows
- Order processing and management
- Email system requirements
- Deployment and branching policies
- Security protocols

If in doubt, ask. Cursor is helpful — but you are the human in charge.

---

## ✅ Enforcement Suggestions
- Use ESLint + Prettier with repo defaults
- Enable `jest --watch` or pre-commit hooks for testing
- Track migration to global styles via TODOs or backlog

Happy gardening 🌼
