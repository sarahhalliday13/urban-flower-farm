# Security and API Guidelines

## Critical Security Rules

1. **API Keys and Secrets**
   - Never expose API keys in code
   - Never commit secrets to repository
   - Never share sensitive credentials
   - Keep all API keys in appropriate environment files

2. **Client-Side Security**
   - No sensitive logic in frontend code
   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials
   - Never use `process.env` in frontend logic
   - Keep all sensitive operations server-side

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Use `.env.local` for local development
   - Use Firebase config for production settings
   - Keep secrets in Firebase functions
   - Never expose environment files

## Proper Implementation

1. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Local Development (.env.local)
   REACT_APP_* # For frontend-safe variables only
   
   # Firebase Functions (.env)
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=****
   OTHER_SENSITIVE_KEYS=****
   ```

2. **Firebase Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Set secrets in Firebase
   firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.api_key="****"
   ```

3. **Server-Side Implementation**
   - Keep sensitive logic in Firebase functions
   - Use proper error handling to avoid exposing details
   - Implement proper authentication checks
   - Log securely without exposing sensitive data

## Security Checklist

Before deploying any changes:

- [ ] No API keys in client code
- [ ] No secrets in version control
- [ ] Sensitive operations are server-side
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Firebase functions properly secured
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose secrets
- [ ] Logging doesn't contain sensitive data

## Important Notes

- Security is non-negotiable
- When in doubt, err on the side of caution
- Report any security concerns immediately
- Regular security audits are required
- Document all security-related changes
