# Archived Image Management Guidelines

This directory contains historical documentation related to image handling in the Urban Flower Farm project.

## Included Guides

1. **Cloudinary Integration** - Original cloud image hosting solution
2. **Google Drive** - Previous file storage system
3. **Imgur Integration** - Legacy image hosting approach
4. **Public Folder** - Original static file handling

## Current Image Handling

The current image handling system uses Firebase Storage. These guides are maintained for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding legacy code
- Troubleshooting old implementations
- Migration context

## Migration Notes

When these systems were migrated to Firebase Storage:
- All new uploads go to Firebase
- Legacy links are still supported
- Gradual migration of old content
- No new implementations of old systems

## Important Note

While these systems are no longer in active use, some legacy content may still reference these methods. When encountering old image links or references, consult these guides for context.
