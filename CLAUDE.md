## Development Workflow
1. **Branches**: 
   - `main` (production)
   - `working-build` (pre-production)
   - `staging` (testing)
   - `development` (active development)

2. **Deploy Commands** - IMPORTANT SAFETY RULES:
   - **NEVER use `firebase deploy` directly** - it deploys to both environments!
   - **Safe staging deploy**: `./deploy.sh staging` or `npm run deploy:staging`
   - **Maintenance page**: `./deploy.sh maintenance`  
   - **Production deploy** (with double confirmation): `./deploy.sh production`
   - **Functions only**: `./deploy.sh functions`
   - **Build locally**: `npm run build`
   - **Test locally**: `npm start`
   - **Emergency restore maintenance**: `./deploy.sh maintenance`

## Important Notes
- **Authentication**: No anonymous auth - admin sign-in required
- **Images**: Must use Firebase Storage URLs, not local paths
- **Orders**: Email confirmations sent automatically on order creation
- **Database**: Using Firebase Realtime Database (not Firestore for main data)

## Common Tasks
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Update inventory: Through Admin Dashboard > Inventory
- Add news: Admin Dashboard > Updates
- Process orders: Admin Dashboard > Orders

## Environment Variables Required
- Firebase configuration (API keys, project ID, etc.)
- SendGrid API key
- Stripe keys

## Known Issues
- React Router v7 warnings (can be ignored)
- Node.js 18 deprecation warning in Firebase Functions
