## üö® IMPORTANT: Production Safeguards

This project has multiple deployment targets. **Always use targeted deployments** to avoid accidentally deploying to production.

## Deployment Commands

### Safe Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy to staging (default)
npm run deploy

# Deploy to staging explicitly
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production (requires double confirmation)
npm run deploy:production
```

### Direct Firebase Commands (Use with caution)

```bash
# Staging only
firebase deploy --only hosting:staging

# Production only (REQUIRES CONFIRMATION)
firebase deploy --only hosting:live

# ‚ö†Ô∏è DANGER: Deploys to BOTH staging and production
firebase deploy  # DO NOT USE
```
